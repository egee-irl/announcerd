Discord-Announcer is a tiny Discord bot that announces when players join game servers to a Discord server.

## Built with ðŸ’– and

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [DiscordJS](https://discord.js.org/#/)
- [ioredis](https://github.com/luin/ioredis)

## Hosting

Discord-Announcer is built for the Egee.io community and works in conjunction with [Log-Parser](https://github.com/Egeeio/gsd-log-parser), however the bot is generic enough that you can easily self-host it on your own server. Use the `./docker/docker-compose.yml` file, and add your Discord token and server id. You'll also need to make sure you have a Redis instance running locally.
